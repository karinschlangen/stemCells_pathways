# this code was used for the creation of (diagnostic) plots, for correlation calculations, and for the calculation of pairwise t-tests
# in order to compare the effect of several inhibitors on different human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) groups

# given: dat_m: data matrix containing the z-scores (columns: stem cell types, rows: inhibitors) and 
# groups: which groups (stem cell types in columns) to be compared (e.g. group1: columns 1,2,3; group2: columns 4,5,6...)

# sample correlation heatmaps
