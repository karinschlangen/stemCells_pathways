Contains R-code used for our Nature Communications paper "Distinct pathway interactomes control cell
cycle, size and survival of human pluripotent stem cells." 

This code was used for the creation of (diagnostic) plots, for correlation calculations, and for the calculation of pairwise t-tests in order to compare the effect of several inhibitors on different human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) groups
